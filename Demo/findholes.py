This is inspired by both the Ultrasonic Basic Obstacle Avoider 
and Ultrasonic_Servo examples. 
Essentially, the gopigo should: 
  - Move fwd until it is within 20cm of an obstacle
  - Stop
  - Scan the room
  - Find a space between obstacles big enough to fit
  - Turn in that direction
  - Move fwd until it is within 20cm of an obstacle
  - Etc.

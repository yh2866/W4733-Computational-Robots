Problem 1:
Done.

Problem 2:
Code implementation is found in dance.py.
We let it dance with different actions: move forward, move backward, turn right, turn left, swipe head.
Also, we let it dance with different speed.

Problem 3:
Code implementation is found in sensor_accuracy.py.
Using a while loop to let it detect distance all the time and put it into fixed distance compare the result with ruler.
For 5 cm, the ultra sonic gave the correct measurement of 5 cm.
For 30 cm, we got 38 cm.
For 60 cm, we got 77 cm.

Problem 4:
Code implementation is found in footprint.py.
For the Method 1, the geometic plot can be found on image "Q4_Method 1"
We keep the robot in the front of object's center, test it several times with different distance.
And the result angle is between 22~40 degree.
For the Method 2, the geometic plot can be found on image "Q4_Method 2"
We keep the robot in the front of object's edge, test it several times with different distance.
And the result angle is between 52~60 degree.
We prefer the method 2, therefore, for the angles of beam, it should be at range of 52~60 degree.

Problem 5:
Code implementation is found in locate_object.py.
